# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to analyze key metrics of ride sharing data from PyBer to compare urban, suburban, and rural city types. A summary DataFrame was created of ride-sharing data by city type, which allowed a deeper look into informating regarding total rides, drivers, and fares by city type and finally a multiple line graph was created that showed total weekly fares for each city type (Urban, Suburban, and Rural).

## Results

The results were different depending on the city type in all categories

Based on the two images above you can see that Urban cities made up the majority of the ride sharing fares and rides, while rural made up the least amount of fares and rides. The more urban and the higher the population of the city is, the more rides and total fares are seen, however there is a decrease in average fare per ride and fare per driver.



## Summary

Urban had the highest number of total rides, however had the lower average fare per ride and per driver. Rural on the other hand had the lowest number of total rides and the highest average fare per ride and per driver. This could be attibuted to the face that urban rides are shorter distances to get to the customers location, while in a rural city locations are further apart. Despite having the lower average fare per ride and driver urban rides had the highest number of total fares. This could be attributed that people in urban cities are less likely to have a car and will rely more on ride sharing services where residents of a rural city are more likely to have their own car for transportation. 

Take aways include:
- Most of ridesharing business is in urban cities with higher populations.
- Consideration for increasing fares in urban cities for increased profit.
- Consider ways/possible promotions to increase business in rural cities.
